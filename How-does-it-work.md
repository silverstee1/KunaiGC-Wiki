The **KunaiGC** is as an IPL-Replacement for the Gamecube.

--- *But what is the IPL and why do one want to replace it?*

IPL stands for (**I**)itial (**P**)rogram (**L**)oader and it is the first program the Gamecube starts on it's bootup.

With an IPL replacement we can decide what the Gamecube starts on bootup. This could be Swiss or any other .dol-File.

--- *How does **KunaiGC** does all of that?*

With an **KunaiGC** installed the Gamecube asks the KunaiGC what to do:
- If the **KunaiGC** is active the KunaiGC loads it's contents from it's Flash e.g. Swiss directly.
- If the **KunaiGC** is inactive the KunaiGC is turned of and the stock Gamecube IPL is used.
