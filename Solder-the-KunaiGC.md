### First you need to get all the needed parts:

1.  Gamecube DOL-001
2.  KunaiGC You need to disassemble the Gamecube (easiest way how to do that: Look at  [iFixits-Guide](https://de.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nintendo+GameCube+Teardown/1727), how to do that)

Disassemble the Gamecube up to the heatsink and now stop for a second.

It's a bit tricky to get the heatsink off, since the thermal pads are most likely the original ones, that are a few years old.

First take of all the screws from the heatsink. 
Now turn on the gamecube for a few minutes, sothat the CPU and GPU are getting warm. This softens the thermal pads and you sould be able to get the heatsink of without much force and hopefully without tearing the pads in the process.

## Now to the soldering:

### With **KunaiGC** you **don't** need to life any pins on the IPL.
So simply lay the QSB-Board over the IPL

### and solder every pin from the QSB to the IPL Chip.

### before aligning the Kunai Modchip make sure to tape the backsite of the PCB to ensure there are no shorts

### align the Kunai and check if it fits in a proper way

### Now you can take the assembled and programmed **KunaiGC** and solder it directly to the QSB.

### after finishing the solder job it should look like this

### To check the soldering you can test at this points:

## With that finished you can put on the heatsink for good and screw it down.
