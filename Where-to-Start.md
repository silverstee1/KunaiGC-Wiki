First of all you need an Gamecube that is compatible.

At the moment **only** the **DOL-001**-Version (that one with the Digital Out-Port) is compatible.

The **DOL-101**-revision will be supported later. It's only a matter of the **KunaiGC** placement on the Gamecubes mainboard.

Now you need an **KunaiGC**.
The **KunaiGC**-Boardfiles are available in this GitHub-Repository so you'll be able to order the PCBs and all needed components by yourself. The soldering is not that hard, if you've done similar things before.


### **And a quick note: You do this mod to your Gamecube on your own risk! We are not responsable for any damage, that happens during installation.**
